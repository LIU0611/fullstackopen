# Full Stack Open - University of Helsinki - 2024
## About the course
The course focuses on Modern JavaScript-based Web Development, particularly on building single-page applications with ReactJS that interact with REST APIs created using Node.js.

The course also covers additional topics, including:
- GraphQL: A modern alternative to REST APIs.
- TypeScript: An open-source, typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- React Native: An open-source UI software framework for creating native mobile applications using JavaScript.
- CI/CD: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
- Docker Containers: An open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications by virtualizing the operating system on which it is installed.

## Course Exercise
### Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps 
*Covers the basics of web applications, their architecture, and the role of the browser and server. Introduces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*

- [New note](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/blob/main/part0/part0.4.jpg) - The diagram shows how the browser and the server communicate when a user adds a note to a page containing JavaScript.
- [Single page app](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/blob/main/part0/part0.5.jpg) - The diagram shows the communication between the browser and the server when a user opens a single page app in the browser.
- [New note (single page app)](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/blob/main/part0/part0.6.jpg) - The diagram shows how the browser and the server communicate when a user adds a note to a single page app.

### Part 1: Introduction to React
*Focuses on the basics of React, including components, props, state, and event handling. Introduces JSX and the concept of a component tree.*

- [Course Information](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/tree/main/part1/courseinfo) - The React component displays a course name, its parts with the number of exercises for each, and the total number of exercises.
- [Unicafe](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/tree/main/part1/unicafe) - The React component allows users to give feedback by clicking buttons and displays the feedback statistics.
- [Anecdotes](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/tree/main/part1/anecdotes) - The React component displays a random anecdote, allows users to vote on it, and shows the anecdote with the most votes.

### Part 2: Communicating with Server
*Teaches how to interact with servers using REST APIs, Axios for HTTP requests, and handling asynchronous operations with Promises and async/await.*

- [Course Information](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/tree/main/part2/courseinfo) - The React component displays a web development curriculum with a list of courses. Each course includes its name, id, and parts, which detail specific topics and the number of exercises for each. The courses are rendered using the Course component.
- [Phonebook](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/tree/main/part2/Phonebook) - The React component manages a phonebook application with functionality to add, update, delete, and filter contacts. It fetches initial data from a server, handles form submissions, and displays notifications for user actions. The component uses state variables for managing contact data, form inputs, and notifications. The UI includes components for displaying and filtering contacts, adding new contacts, and showing notifications.
- [Countries with Weather](https://github.com/LIU0611/fullstackopen/tree/main/part2/countries): The React component displays a country and weather information application. It allows users to search for countries, view detailed information about a selected country, and see the current weather for its capital. The component fetches country data from an external API based on the user's query, displays a list of matching countries, and shows detailed information including languages, areas, and flags for a selected country. If only one country matches the search, it automatically fetches and displays the current weather for that country's capital.

### Part 3: Programming a Server with NodeJS and Express
*Introduces backend development with Node.js and Express, covering routing, middleware, and building RESTful APIs. Emphasizes creating a full-stack application by connecting the front end to the back end.*

- 

### Part 4: Testing Express Servers, User Administration
*Discusses testing Node.js applications using Jest and Supertest. Covers user authentication and authorization, including hashing passwords and handling user sessions.*

- 

### Part 5: Testing React Apps
*Focuses on testing React applications with React Testing Library and Jest. Covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure application reliability.*

- 

### Part 6: Advanced State Management
*Introduces Redux for state management in larger applications. Covers actions, reducers, and the Redux store, as well as using Redux Toolkit for simplifying state logic.*

-

### Part 7: React Router, Custom Hooks, CSS and Webpack
*Enhances React applications with React Router for navigation, custom hooks for reusable logic, advanced CSS techniques, and Webpack for bundling assets.*

- 

### Part 8: GraphQL
*Teaches the basics of GraphQL, a query language for APIs. Covers defining a schema, writing queries and mutations, and using Apollo Client for integrating GraphQL in React applications.*

- 

### Part 9: TypeScript
*Introduces TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript. Covers types, interfaces, and using TypeScript with React and Node.js for improved code quality and developer experience.*

- 

### Part 10: React Native
*Focuses on building mobile applications with React Native, covering components, styling, navigation, and accessing device capabilities.*

- 

### Part 11: CI/CD
*Covers Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices, including setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions and deploying applications to various environments.*

- 

### Part 12: Containers
*Introduces containerization using Docker. Covers creating Docker images, writing Dockerfiles, and managing containers for development and production environments.*

- 

### Part 13: Using Relational Databases
*Teaches how to work with SQL databases. Covers database design, writing SQL queries, and integrating databases with backend applications using ORMs like Sequelize.*
