# Full Stack Open - University of Helsinki - 2024
## About the course
This repository includes my assignment submissions for the Helsinki University Full Stack Open 2021 course (https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

The course focuses on Modern JavaScript-based Web Development, particularly on building single-page applications with ReactJS that interact with REST APIs created using Node.js.

The course also covers additional topics, including:
- GraphQL: A modern alternative to REST APIs.
- TypeScript: An open-source, typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- React Native: An open-source UI software framework for creating native mobile applications using JavaScript.
- CI/CD: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
- Docker Containers: An open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications by virtualizing the operating system on which it is installed.
